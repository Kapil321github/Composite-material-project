# Composite-material-project
1.Material Science Project
   I did a project on composite material where I made a composite of Al6061 and Silicon Carbide and analyzed and compared the properties of the composite with the properties of Al6061.

Tests  done on the composite : Izod test,  Rockwell Hardness test, Tensile test, Compression test.

Tools  & Technologies used: Universal Testing Machine, Milling Machine, Power saw, Lathe Machine, Rockwell hardness Tester.
Duration of Project : From 5th semester to Present
